"# react-frontend-testing" 
## Handout (For Frontend)

Set up:
### `npm install --force`
(add --force to avoid conflicts, because there are some updates of reactjs)

Running:
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
(If you running Backend in port 3000, can use another port for reactjs, 3001 is recommended)

Testing
### `npm test`
(I wrote login.test.ts, some conflicts can be occurring, depending on version and configuration)

Cleaning:
### `npx eslint src`
(My code is cleaned)
